Step-by-Step Solution

Full System Reset
-----------------

First, let's completely clear all Bluetooth state:

sudo systemctl stop bluetooth
sudo rm -rf /var/lib/bluetooth/*
sudo systemctl start bluetooth

Keyboard Hardware Reset
-----------------------

Turn off the keyboard
Press and hold the Bluetooth pairing button for 15 seconds (this performs a full reset)
Release and wait for the LED to blink rapidly

Special Pairing Mode
--------------------

Run these commands in order:

bluetoothctl
power on
agent off
agent NoInputNoOutput
default-agent
scan on

When you see your keyboard appear 
[NEW] Device DC:13:14:4D:AA:33 G515 LS TKL

run: (update command with correct address)
pair DC:13:14:4D:AA:33

Wait for 30 seconds - sometimes the pairing takes longer to complete
